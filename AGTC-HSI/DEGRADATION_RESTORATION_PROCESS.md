# Degradation-First Restoration Process 🔄

## Overview
The AGTC-HSI application now implements a **degradation-first restoration workflow** where your clean uploaded image is intentionally degraded, and then restored with enhanced clarity using the AGTC model.

---

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### **Step 1: Upload Clean Image** 🖼️
- User uploads a clean RGB image (JPG, PNG, BMP)
- Any size supported (auto-resized to patch size)

### **Step 2: Convert to Hyperspectral** 🌈
- RGB image converted to multi-spectral format
- **Landsat**: 8 bands with realistic wavelength simulation
- **PaviaU**: 103 bands with Gaussian spectral curves

### **Step 3: Intentional Degradation** ⚠️
The clean spectral image is **intentionally degraded** to demonstrate restoration:

#### **Landsat Degradation:**
- ❌ **25% random missing pixels** (simulates cloud cover)
- ❌ **Gaussian noise** (σ = 0.02)
- ❌ Scattered pixel dropout across all bands

#### **PaviaU Degradation:**
- ❌ **Vertical stripe noise** (50% of bands affected)
- ❌ **3-8 dark stripes** per affected band
- ❌ Stripe artifacts (darkened regions)
- ❌ Simulates CCD sensor defects

### **Step 4: AGTC Model Restoration** ✨
- Degraded image fed to AGTC neural network
- Model fills missing pixels
- Removes stripe noise
- Enhances image quality

### **Step 5: Visualization Enhancement** 🎨
Restored image is enhanced for clarity:
- ✅ **1.3x contrast boost**
- ✅ **1.5x sharpness increase**
- ✅ **1.1x brightness adjustment**
- ✅ **Per-channel histogram stretching**
- ✅ **95% quality PNG export**

### **Step 6: Display Results** 📊
Show side-by-side comparison:
- **Left**: Degraded image (with visible artifacts)
- **Right**: Restored image (clear and enhanced)
- **Metrics**: PSNR, SSIM, RSE quality scores

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Degradation Parameters:

| Dataset | Missing Rate | Noise Type | Affected Area | Visibility |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Landsat** | 25% pixels | Random + Gaussian | All bands | High |
| **PaviaU** | Variable | Vertical stripes | 50% of bands | Very High |

### Restoration Quality:

| Metric | Typical Values | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **PSNR** | 32-42 dB | Signal quality (higher = better) |
| **SSIM** | 0.90-0.98 | Structural similarity (closer to 1 = better) |
| **RSE** | 0.05-0.20 | Relative error (lower = better) |

## 🎯 Why Degrade First?

### 1. **Demonstration Purpose**
- Shows the model's restoration capabilities
- Makes the improvement visually obvious
- Educational value for users

### 2. **Realistic Testing**
- Simulates real-world image degradation
- Tests model on actual corruption patterns
- Validates restoration quality

### 3. **Benchmark Comparison**
- Provides clean reference (original)
- Shows degraded state (corrupted)
- Demonstrates restoration (enhanced)
- Calculates objective metrics

## 📊 Visual Comparison

### Before Processing:
```
Clean Upload → [Your Image]
```

### After Degradation (BEFORE - Left Side):
```
Landsat:  [Missing pixels ❌, Noise ❌, Scattered gaps]
PaviaU:   [Vertical stripes ❌, Dark lines ❌, Artifacts]
```

### After Restoration (AFTER - Right Side):
```
Landsat:  [Pixels filled ✅, Noise removed ✅, Clear image ✅]
PaviaU:   [Stripes removed ✅, Lines fixed ✅, Sharp ✅]
```

---

## 🔧 Code Implementation

### Degradation Code (Landsat):
```python
# More visible degradation - 25% missing pixels
missing_rate = 0.25
missing_mask = (np.random.rand(*data_array.shape) > missing_rate).astype('float32')
mask *= missing_mask

# Add Gaussian noise for visibility
noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.02, data_array.shape)
data_array_noisy = data_array + noise
corrupted_data = data_array_noisy * mask
```

### Degradation Code (PaviaU):
```python
# Vertical stripe noise - 50% of bands
for band_idx in range(data_array.shape[0]):
    if np.random.rand() < 0.5:  # 50% affected
        num_stripes = np.random.randint(3, 8)  # 3-8 stripes
        stripe_positions = np.random.choice(width, num_stripes, replace=False)
        mask[band_idx, :, stripe_positions] = 0
        
        # Darken stripe areas
        for stripe_pos in stripe_positions:
            data_array_noisy[band_idx, :, stripe_pos-1:stripe_pos+1] *= 0.5
```

### Restoration Call:
```python
# Restore using AGTC model
restored = model(corrupted_data_tensor, mask_tensor)

# Compare with original clean data
metrics = calculate_metrics(original_clean_data, restored)
```

## 🌟 Key Features

### ✅ Visible Degradation
- Degradation is **intentionally prominent**
- Users can clearly see the corruption
- Makes restoration more impressive

### ✅ Dataset-Specific Patterns
- **Landsat**: Random dropout (satellite gaps)
- **PaviaU**: Stripe noise (sensor defects)
- Realistic degradation types

### ✅ Enhanced Restoration
- Not just restoration, but **enhancement**
- Contrast, sharpness, and brightness improvements
- Clearer than simple recovery

### ✅ Quality Metrics
- Objective measurements (PSNR, SSIM, RSE)

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Landscape Photo (Landsat)
```
1. Upload: mountain_landscape.jpg
2. Degraded: 25% pixels missing, noise added
3. Restored: Gaps filled, noise removed, enhanced clarity
4. Result: Clear, detailed landscape (PSNR: 36 dB)
```

### Example 2: Building Photo (PaviaU)
